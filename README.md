### :rocket: Project: 5 & DIME
    5 & DIME is a webapp developed for connecting local shops to their regular customers by online
    mode and thus also maintaining social distancing, here shops can ask for donation if they really 
    need some funding, shops can also put up advertisements for offers.
### :dart: Final prototye of project: 
    The final prototype of our project is able to perform these actions.
    1. Login/Register a new user as a customer.
    2. Login/Register a new user as a shop owner.
    3. Shop owner can add his/her shop to our website.
    4. Donation feature for shops who need donation.
    5. Customers will be able to see shops and number of people in queue at that shop in his/her area.
       For performing this filter process customer will follow these three steps.
       a) First filter on the basis of pin code.
       b) Second filter on the basis of area/locality.
       c) Third filter on the basis of shop name.
    6. Customer will be able to add himself to queue at any shop with the list of goodies needed by registering through his phone number.
    7. Customer will receive a message at the time of registering and one other message X minute before he/she should visit the shop.
    8. Shop owner will be able to show offers of his/her shop.
    9. Shop owner will be able to modify queue on the basis of FIFO (First in first out algorithm).
